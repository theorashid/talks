## Speeding-up spatial modelling

SpatVAE paper
Inference for big dimensions is slow. Spatial is highly correlated so poor MCMC mixing

Variational autoencoder learning GP priors

<!-- .slide: data-background="#343434" -->
decoder only spits out GP priors when given random noise

<!-- .slide: data-background="#343434" -->
decoder only spits out GP posterior when optimised __z__

Only have to infer a vector â€“ not a full spatial structure.

Speed-ups. Efficiency increase.
