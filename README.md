# talks
presentations etc

Each topic lies in `slides/_theme/`. Markdown files contain the slide content, and media is held in the `assets/` folders.

Move a presentation file from `presentations/` to the main folder. Open it with a broswer or run `npm start`.

The `index.html` file converts the markdown files into a presentation using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).
